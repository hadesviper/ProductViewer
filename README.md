# ProductViewer

An open source application that's based on MVVM clean architecture pattern.

Uses dagger hilt for dependency injection.

Uses Retrofit as a Rest client.

When you first open the app you will see the products list screen, if you clicked on any product it will navigate to product details screen.

If the app is loaded once with internet connection you can load it any time again in offline mode as it chaches the retrived data and images.
